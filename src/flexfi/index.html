  <h1>What is FlexFI?</h1>
  <p><strong>FlexFI</strong> is a modern approach to Financial Independence that recognizes life isn’t static. Unlike rigid savings formulas or one-size-fits-all goals, FlexFI adapts as your circumstances, priorities, and responsibilities change over time.</p>

  <h2>Why FlexFI?</h2>
  <p>Traditional FI frameworks—like Lean FI, Coast FI, and Barista FI—are helpful, but they assume stability. In reality, your financial strategy needs to bend and flex as life evolves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Starting Out:</strong> You might aggressively save and invest while expenses are lower.</li>
    <li><strong>Raising a Family:</strong> Priorities shift. Housing, childcare, and healthcare may require balancing take-home pay with retirement contributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Midlife & Caregiving:</strong> Aging parents, career pivots, or health needs can change what “enough” looks like.</li>
    <li><strong>Later Life:</strong> With kids launched and expenses dropping, you may choose to accelerate savings again to reach full FI earlier than traditional retirement age.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How FlexFI Works</h2>
  <p>Instead of aiming for a single, unchanging savings rate, FlexFI embraces different phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjusting contributions as your cost of living rises or falls</li>
    <li>Balancing long-term growth with short-term flexibility</li>
    <li>Re-evaluating your FI plan as life circumstances evolve</li>
  </ul>

    <thead>
      <tr><th>Approach</th><th>Philosophy</th></tr>

    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Lean FI</td><td>Achieve FI with minimal lifestyle expenses</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Coast FI</td><td>Save early, then let compounding carry you</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Barista FI</td><td>Reach partial FI, cover gap with part-time work</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>FlexFI</strong></td><td>Adapt your FI journey dynamically across life stages</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>FlexFI acknowledges the reality many of us live: high housing costs, kids, healthcare, career transitions, or caregiving for loved ones. It gives you permission to adjust without “failing” at FI.</p>

  <p>By practicing FlexFI, you can stay on the path to Financial Independence while still prioritizing what matters most today.</p>
