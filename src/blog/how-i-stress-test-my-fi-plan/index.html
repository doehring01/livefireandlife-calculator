  <h1>How I Stress-Test My FI Plan (A Practical Framework)</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    I don’t trust an FI plan because the math works in a spreadsheet.
    I trust it only after I’ve tried to break it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stress-testing isn’t about predicting the future.
    It’s about making sure your plan still works — or can adapt — when things don’t go as expected.
  </p>

  <h2>Why stress-testing matters more than optimization</h2>
  <p>
    Most FI plans fail at the edges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not because someone miscalculated a return,
    but because the plan assumed life would cooperate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stress-testing forces you to confront uncomfortable questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What if markets drop early?</li>
    <li>What if spending rises?</li>
    <li>What if income takes longer than expected to replace?</li>
    <li>What if priorities change?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The mindset: pressure over precision</h2>
  <p>
    I’m not looking for the perfect answer.
    I’m looking for a plan that doesn’t collapse under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a small change breaks the plan, the plan is too tight.
  </p>

  <h2>My stress-test framework</h2>

  <h3>1. Inflate spending on purpose</h3>
  <p>
    I start by increasing projected annual spending by 15–20%.
  </p>

  <p>
    This accounts for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthcare variability</li>
    <li>Lifestyle expansion</li>
    <li>Inflation surprises</li>
    <li>“Freedom costs” that don’t exist while working</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the plan only works at today’s spending, it’s not ready.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Insert a bad market early</h3>
  <p>
    Next, I model a significant market downturn in the first few years.
  </p>

  <p>
    This tests sequence of returns risk — not as theory, but as lived experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t ask, “Does this fail?”
    I ask, “What would I do if this happened?”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Delay optional income</h3>
  <p>
    Many FI plans quietly assume part-time work, consulting, or side income.
  </p>

  <p>
    I delay that income by 2–3 years in my models.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the plan collapses without it, I know where the real dependency is.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Reduce flexibility and see what breaks</h3>
  <p>
    I temporarily remove:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Spending cuts</li>
    <li>Geographic arbitrage</li>
    <li>Portfolio reallocations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the plan only works with perfect execution, it’s fragile.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Identify the weakest assumption</h3>
  <p>
    Every plan depends on one or two core assumptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stress-testing reveals them quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s where I focus improvements — not on squeezing another 0.2% of return.
  </p>

  <h2>What I’m looking for at the end</h2>
  <p>
    I’m not trying to prove the plan is invincible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to know:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Where flexibility matters most</li>
    <li>Which risks deserve real buffers</li>
    <li>What I would do before panic sets in</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The biggest lesson</h2>
  <p>
    Stress-testing turns FI from a finish line into a system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Systems survive change.
    Rigid plans don’t.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    If your FI plan can survive higher spending, bad markets, and delayed income,
    you’re not just financially independent — you’re resilient.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Next step:</strong> Pick one assumption your plan relies on most and stress-test it this week.
    That’s where real confidence comes from.
