    <p class="lede">Healthcare can be the single biggest swing factor in your FI plan. Here’s the standard playbook—plus creative options many people overlook.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>The “standard” paths (pre-65)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ACA Marketplace:</strong> Control MAGI to qualify for premium credits; choose high-value Silver plans with CSR if eligible.</li>
      <li><strong>COBRA / Retiree coverage:</strong> Useful as a bridge year (e.g., between jobs and ACA open enrollment).</li>
      <li><strong>HSA strategy:</strong> Pair HDHP + invest HSA; pay expenses out of pocket now, reimburse later tax-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-65 (Medicare)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand A/B/D basics and timing to avoid penalties.</li>
      <li><strong>Medigap vs Advantage:</strong> Medigap = broader access/predictability; Advantage = network-managed tradeoffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hidden costs to budget explicitly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dental, vision, audiology.</li>
      <li>Fertility, maternity, mental health.</li>
      <li>Long-term care risk; consider partial self-funding or hybrid policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Out-of-the-box options (pro/cons)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Direct Primary Care (DPC):</strong> Monthly membership for unlimited primary care; pair with a wraparound catastrophic plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Part-time employment for benefits:</strong> Some employers offer health insurance at 20–30 hrs/week—acts like a subsidy while preserving lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical tourism:</strong> Elective procedures abroad with accredited hospitals; plan for follow-up care at home.</li>
      <li><strong>Expat/Global insurance:</strong> If living abroad part/all year, international policies can be cheaper with quality networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthsharing ministries/ALOs:</strong> Not insurance; lower costs but <em>real</em> coverage gaps and contract risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-insuring deductibles:</strong> Maintain a dedicated “medical reserve” to raise deductibles and cut premiums.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MAGI management (the lever you control)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize taxable withdrawals/dividend control, Roth conversions, and capital gains timing.</li>
      <li>Use charitable tools (QCDs post-70½, donor-advised funds) to hit bracket targets while meeting giving goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case study: retiring at 50</h2>
    <p>Target spend $70k; by blending taxable withdrawals + small Roth conversions and limiting ordinary income, a couple can retain ACA support and lower lifetime tax—while keeping a DPC membership for primary care access.</p>

    <h2>Your annual healthcare checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Estimate next year’s healthcare line item (premiums + OOP max + routine care).</li>
      <li>Choose a plan during open enrollment that fits your providers and expected usage.</li>
      <li>Set a <strong>medical reserve</strong> equal to your plan’s OOP max.</li>
      <li>Map MAGI targets for subsidies/IRMAA and plan conversions/withdrawals accordingly.</li>
    </ol>

    <div style="background:#f0fdf4;border:1px solid #bbf7d0;padding:1rem;border-radius:8px;margin:1rem 0;">
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Treat healthcare like a project: define requirements, pick a strategy, and review annually. Creativity can save thousands without sacrificing care.
