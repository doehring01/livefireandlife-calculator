      <p>Traditional FI advice often assumes a straight line: set a high savings rate, invest consistently, then wait for compounding to carry you across the finish line. But real life isn’t linear. Costs rise, kids arrive, parents age, health changes, and careers zig-zag.</p>

      <p><strong>FlexFI</strong> is a simple idea: keep your long-term FI goal, but adjust the plan to fit the stage of life you’re in. It’s FI with seasons—strategic when you can be, flexible when you need to be.</p>

      <h2>FlexFI in practice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early career:</strong> push savings rates higher while expenses are lighter.</li>
        <li><strong>Raising kids / HCOL:</strong> tune contributions down if cash flow is tight; keep the employer match and high-ROI pre-tax accounts (401k/HSA) if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Caregiving / transitions:</strong> maintain liquidity and reduce volatility; revisit annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Empty nest / higher earning years:</strong> dial contributions up again to accelerate the FI date.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>There’s no single “right” number</h2>
      <p>Every extra % into a 401(k) lowers taxable income—great. But it can also squeeze your monthly budget when housing, childcare, or eldercare costs surge. The right answer today may be different from the right answer next year.</p>

      <h2>How FlexFI fits with other FI “flavors”</h2>
      <p>Lean FI, Coast FI, and Barista FI describe endpoints or modes. FlexFI describes the <em>path</em>: adjusting your plan between these modes as your priorities shift.</p>

      <h2>Final thought</h2>
      <p>FlexFI is permission to adapt without feeling like you’ve failed at FI. It’s not about doing less—it’s about doing the right thing for the season you’re in while still moving toward independence.</p>
