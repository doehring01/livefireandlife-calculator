    Increasing your income isn’t only about raises or side hustles. How you manage benefits, contributions, and
    withholding can have a big impact on what actually lands in your checking account. Below are five practical levers
    you can adjust today.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Optimize pre-tax contributions</h2>
  <p>
    Contributions to accounts like a 401(k), HSA, or FSA reduce taxable income. Even a small increase in pre-tax
    contributions can lower your tax bill while building long-term wealth. If cash flow is tight, try small bumps
    (for example, +1% each quarter) instead of a large jump.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Review your withholding</h2>
  <p>
    Many people withhold too much or too little. Use the IRS withholding estimator to check whether you should adjust
    your W-4 so you’re not giving the government an interest-free loan or facing a surprise bill.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Leverage employer benefits</h2>
  <p>
    Commuter benefits, dependent care FSAs, tuition assistance, and wellness stipends can stretch your dollars by
    covering expenses with pre-tax money or direct subsidies. Spend a few minutes in your HR portal to make sure
    you’re enrolled in what you actually use.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Compare health plan options</h2>
  <p>
    High-deductible health plans often come with HSA eligibility, which pairs lower premiums with tax-free savings for
    healthcare. Depending on your situation, switching plans can free up monthly cash flow even after accounting for a
    higher deductible.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Track the real impact</h2>
  <p>
    Use the <a href="/calculators/take-home-pay/">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a> to model contribution levels, withholding,
    and benefits side by side. Seeing the numbers makes it easier to choose the mix that balances cash flow and
    long-term growth.
