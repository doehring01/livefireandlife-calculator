        Increasing your income isn’t only about raises or side hustles—how you manage benefits, contributions, and 
        withholdings can have a huge impact on what actually lands in your checking account. This article walks 
        through simple, practical levers you can adjust today.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Optimize Pre-Tax Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Contributions to accounts like your 401(k), HSA, or FSA reduce taxable income. Even a small increase in 
        contributions can lower your tax liability while building long-term wealth.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Review Your Withholding</h2>
      <p>
        Many employees are withholding too much or too little. Use the IRS withholding calculator to see if you 
        should adjust your W-4 so you’re not giving the IRS an interest-free loan or facing a surprise bill.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Leverage Employer Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        From commuter benefits to dependent care FSAs, your HR portal may have hidden gems. These can boost your 
        effective take-home pay by covering expenses with pre-tax dollars.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Compare Health Plan Options</h2>
      <p>
        High-deductible health plans often come with HSA eligibility—combining lower premiums with tax-free savings 
        for healthcare. Depending on your situation, this can free up monthly cash flow.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Track the Real Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Use our <a href="/calculators/take-home-pay/">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a> to model different contribution 
        levels, tax scenarios, and benefits. Seeing the numbers side by side makes it easier to choose the 
        contribution mix that balances cash flow and long-term growth.
