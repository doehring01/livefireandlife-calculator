    <h1>The Hidden Costs of FI People Forget to Plan For</h1>

    <p>Most FI math assumes a neat withdrawal rate, steady markets, and predictable expenses. Real life doesn’t work
    like that. Here are four hidden costs that can surprise even careful planners — and how to build protection into
    your strategy.</p>

    <h2>1. Healthcare after leaving employer coverage</h2>
    <p>In the U.S., premiums and out-of-pocket costs can rival a mortgage. If you’re abroad in a universal healthcare
    system, costs may be lower, but coverage gaps still exist (dental, vision, long-term care). Budget for this line
    explicitly in your FI plan.</p>

    <h2>2. Taxes in retirement</h2>
    <p>Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts, capital gains, and state taxes can all cut into your “4% rule” number.
    Running scenarios with different withdrawal strategies makes the difference between stability and surprises.</p>

    <h2>3. Kids and family support</h2>
    <p>Raising children, fertility treatments, education, or helping aging parents are all expenses that don’t
    disappear just because you’re financially independent. They can dramatically reshape timelines if not planned for.</p>

    <h2>4. Lifestyle inflation</h2>
    <p>The FI community often warns about this, but it sneaks up anyway. A bigger house, more travel, or higher
    “baseline” spending means your FI number needs to be recalibrated.</p>

    <h2>Building resilience into your FI plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a “buffer” in your FI number for healthcare and family costs.</li>
      <li>Revisit your plan annually to update for taxes and lifestyle shifts.</li>
      <li>Use tools like the <a href="/calculators/net-worth-tracker/">Net Worth Tracker</a> to see how your safety
      margin holds up under different assumptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>FI isn’t about perfection. It’s about resilience. Accounting for the hidden costs keeps your plan alive
    through life’s surprises.</p>
