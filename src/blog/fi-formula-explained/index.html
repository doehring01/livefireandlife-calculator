      <h1>The FI Formula, Explained</h1>
      <p><em>Published: 2025 • Reading time: ~6 minutes</em></p>

      <p>
        Financial Independence (FI) boils down to one deceptively simple formula:
        <strong>your annual expenses × 25 = your FI number</strong>. But there’s more nuance behind it—
        from taxes, to investment returns, to flexibility in your plan. Let’s walk through it.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Know Your Annual Spending</h2>
      <p>
        Start with your actual lifestyle costs—housing, food, transportation, insurance, travel.
        If you need $50,000/year, that’s your baseline.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Apply the 4% Rule (or 25× Rule)</h2>
      <p>
        Multiply your annual spending by 25. This assumes a safe withdrawal rate of ~4% from a diversified portfolio.
        In our example: <code>$50,000 × 25 = $1.25M</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3: Adjust for Flexibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> withdrawals aren’t always tax-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> costs can vary dramatically.</li>
        <li><strong>FlexFI:</strong> save more in some seasons, less in others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Revisit Often</h2>
      <p>
        FI isn’t one-and-done. Life changes, markets shift, kids grow. Re-run your numbers regularly.
