  <h1>Asset Allocation for Different Stages of Life</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    Asset allocation advice often sounds universal.
    In reality, the “right” allocation depends heavily on where you are in life — not just how old you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your income stability, flexibility, responsibilities, and timeline matter just as much as expected returns.
  </p>

  <h2>The mistake: treating asset allocation as static</h2>
  <p>
    Many investors pick an allocation early on and rarely revisit it.
  </p>

  <p>
    But asset allocation isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it decision.
    It’s a tool that should evolve as your life changes.
  </p>

  <h2>What asset allocation is really doing</h2>
  <p>
    At its core, asset allocation balances three competing needs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Growth</li>
    <li>Stability</li>
    <li>Liquidity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Which of these matters most depends on your current season.
  </p>

  <h2>Early career and accumulation: maximizing growth</h2>
  <p>
    In the early stages, time and earning power are your biggest assets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Common characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Long time horizon</li>
    <li>Stable or growing income</li>
    <li>High ability to recover from downturns</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Portfolios here often emphasize equities heavily.
    Volatility is uncomfortable, but it’s usually survivable.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Primary goal:</strong> Growth over short-term stability.</p>

  <h2>Mid-career and family-building: balancing growth and resilience</h2>
  <p>
    As responsibilities increase, the cost of volatility changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Income may still be strong, but flexibility is often lower.
    Cash flow matters more than theoretical returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Asset allocation here often becomes more diversified:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Still equity-focused</li>
    <li>But with more attention to bonds, cash, or diversifiers</li>
    <li>Greater emphasis on emergency and sinking funds</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Primary goal:</strong> Grow wealth without forcing bad decisions during downturns.</p>

  <h2>Approaching FI: managing risk and liquidity</h2>
  <p>
    As FI gets closer, timing risk increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    Large market drops matter more when withdrawals are on the horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Allocation decisions increasingly focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reducing sequence of returns risk</li>
    <li>Ensuring liquidity for near-term needs</li>
    <li>Maintaining psychological comfort</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This doesn’t mean abandoning growth —
    it means aligning risk with upcoming cash needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Early retirement: cash flow over optimization</h2>
  <p>
    Once withdrawals begin, portfolios serve a different role.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus shifts from maximizing returns to sustaining cash flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Diversification, buffers, and flexibility become more important than squeezing out extra growth.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Primary goal:</strong> Avoid being forced to sell assets at the wrong time.</p>

  <h2>A better question to ask</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of asking, “What allocation should I have?”
    ask:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What risks can I tolerate right now?</li>
    <li>What risks would force bad decisions?</li>
    <li>What money needs to be available soon?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Those answers point toward a more appropriate allocation than any generic rule.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    Asset allocation isn’t about finding the perfect mix.
    It’s about matching your portfolio to your life.
  </p>

  <p>
    When your allocation supports your current season,
    staying invested becomes much easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Next step:</strong> Review your allocation through the lens of your life stage —
    not just your age.
