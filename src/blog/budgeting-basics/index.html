    <h1>Basics of Budgeting & Budgeting Types</h1>

    <p>Budgeting isn’t about spreadsheets for the sake of spreadsheets — it’s about clarity. The right budget helps you
    see where your money actually goes, adjust in real time, and make progress toward financial independence (FI)
    without sacrificing the present.</p>

    <h2>Why budgeting matters for FI</h2>
    <p>Every FI journey comes down to two numbers: how much you save and how much you spend. Budgeting is the bridge
    between intention and action, showing you where the gap is and what you can realistically change.</p>

    <h2>Four popular budgeting methods</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>50/30/20 Rule:</strong> 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings. Easy to start, but not precise enough for FI-focused plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero-Based Budget:</strong> Every dollar gets assigned a job. Great for detail-oriented people, but high effort.</li>
      <li><strong>Pay Yourself First:</strong> Automate savings, then live on what’s left. Simple and effective for FI, though it requires discipline.</li>
      <li><strong>Values-Based Budget:</strong> Focus spending on what matters most (travel, family, hobbies) and cut the rest. Helps avoid burnout on the FI path.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Which method fits your FI journey?</h2>
    <p>If you’re just getting started, the 50/30/20 rule is a useful baseline. But once you aim for higher savings
    rates, zero-based or pay-yourself-first methods give you more control. Values-based budgeting is particularly
    powerful for FlexFI because it ensures your lifestyle today isn’t sacrificed in the name of a distant goal.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Try setting up two parallel budgets: one that captures your “baseline” lifestyle and another that models a
    higher-savings lifestyle. Switching between them as life evolves is budgeting in FlexFI action.</p>
