    <h1>Should You Save More or Earn More on the Path to FI?</h1>

    <p>Ask any FI enthusiast and you’ll hear two competing strategies: cut your spending hard or grow your income
    aggressively. Both matter — but the smartest path may be a blend, with Coast FI offering a flexible third option.</p>

    <h2>The case for saving more</h2>
    <p>Cutting expenses has immediate impact. Every dollar not spent is a dollar saved — and it lowers your eventual FI
    number. But extreme frugality can backfire if it makes your life feel smaller or unsustainable.</p>

    <h2>The case for earning more</h2>
    <p>Boosting income grows both savings and lifestyle potential. Negotiating raises, building side income, or
    switching careers can supercharge FI. But lifestyle creep can eat away the benefits if spending rises too quickly.</p>

    <h2>Enter Coast FI</h2>
    <p>Coast FI is the middle path. Once you’ve invested enough that compound growth alone can carry you to FI by a
    target age, you no longer need to contribute heavily. You can “coast” by working less, taking lower-stress jobs,
    or balancing family and personal goals without derailing your future independence.</p>

    <h2>How to decide which lever to pull</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with an honest look at your <a href="/calculators/net-worth-tracker/">Net Worth</a>.</li>
      <li>If savings are low relative to expenses, trimming spending may help fastest.</li>
      <li>If you’re already lean, focus on income growth.</li>
      <li>If you’re ahead of schedule, consider Coast FI to buy back time and flexibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>FI doesn’t have to be “save more or earn more.” In practice, it’s often both — with Coast FI providing a
    pressure-release valve. The best strategy is the one that keeps you consistent and motivated for the long haul.</p>
