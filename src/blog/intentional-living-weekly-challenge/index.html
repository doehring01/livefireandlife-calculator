  <h1>A Simple Intentional Living Challenge (One Week, No Overhaul)</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    You don’t need a major life reset to live more intentionally.
    Small adjustments — done consistently — matter far more.
  </p>

  <p>
    This short challenge is designed to help you realign time, energy, and money
    without changing everything at once.
  </p>

  <h2>The tool: your weekly reset check-in</h2>
  <p>
    This exercise takes about 10–15 minutes and works best at the start or end of a week.
  </p>

  <p>
    All you need is a notebook or notes app.
  </p>

  <h2>The one-week intentional living challenge</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Name one energy drain</h3>
  <p>
    Identify one thing this week that consistently drains your energy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A recurring obligation</li>
    <li>An unnecessary expense</li>
    <li>A commitment you’ve outgrown</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Don’t try to fix everything. Just name one.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Name one energizing activity</h3>
  <p>
    Identify one thing that reliably improves your mood or sense of alignment.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Movement or time outdoors</li>
    <li>Focused creative work</li>
    <li>Meaningful connection</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This doesn’t need to be dramatic — consistency matters more than intensity.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Make one small trade</h3>
  <p>
    This is the core of the challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reduce the drain slightly.
    Increase the energizing activity slightly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even a 10–15 minute shift counts.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Notice, don’t judge</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout the week, pay attention to how the change feels.
  </p>

  <p>
    No optimization. No perfection.
    Just observation.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this works</h2>
  <p>
    Intentional living isn’t about dramatic changes.
    It’s about aligning small choices with what actually matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    This same mindset applies to FI:
    small, consistent decisions compound into meaningful freedom.
  </p>

  <h2>How this connects to Financial Independence</h2>
  <p>
    FI isn’t just about leaving work.
    It’s about reducing friction and increasing choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Practicing intentional living now builds the skills needed to enjoy that freedom later.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    You don’t need a new life.
    You need a few better-aligned weeks in a row.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Next step:</strong> Try this challenge once.
    If it helps, make it a weekly habit.
