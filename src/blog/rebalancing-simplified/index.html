  <h1>Rebalancing Simplified: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    Rebalancing is one of those investing tasks that sounds more complicated than it actually is.
    Most people don’t struggle because it’s hard — they struggle because they overthink it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of rebalancing isn’t perfection.
    It’s keeping your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and life stage.
  </p>

  <h2>What rebalancing actually does</h2>
  <p>
    Over time, different assets grow at different rates.
    Left alone, your portfolio slowly drifts away from its original allocation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rebalancing is simply the process of bringing things back into alignment.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s less about chasing returns and more about controlling risk.
  </p>

  <h2>The biggest rebalancing mistake</h2>
  <p>
    The most common mistake isn’t rebalancing too little —
    it’s rebalancing too often.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frequent tinkering increases taxes, trading costs, and emotional decision-making.
  </p>

  <h2>When you should rebalance</h2>
  <p>
    There are two simple triggers that work well for most people:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Calendar-based:</strong> Once or twice per year</li>
    <li><strong>Threshold-based:</strong> When an asset class drifts 5–10% from target</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You don’t need both.
    Pick one and be consistent.
  </p>

  <h2>A simple step-by-step rebalancing process</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Reconfirm your target allocation</h3>
  <p>
    Before touching anything, confirm your desired allocation still makes sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your life has changed — income, family, timeline —
    your target may need adjustment.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Use new money first</h3>
  <p>
    Whenever possible, rebalance using new contributions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This avoids unnecessary selling and tax consequences.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Rebalance inside tax-advantaged accounts</h3>
  <p>
    If selling is required, prioritize rebalancing inside retirement accounts
    where trades don’t trigger taxes.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Only sell in taxable accounts if necessary</h3>
  <p>
    If you must rebalance in a brokerage account, be mindful of capital gains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes doing nothing is better than triggering a large tax bill.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5: Stop once you’re “close enough”</h3>
  <p>
    You don’t need exact percentages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being within a few percent of target is usually more than sufficient.
  </p>

  <h2>Rebalancing during market downturns</h2>
  <p>
    Rebalancing feels hardest when markets are volatile.
  </p>

  <p>
    That discomfort is often a sign the process is working —
    it forces you to buy what’s down and trim what’s run up.
  </p>

  <h2>How this fits into FI planning</h2>
  <p>
    Rebalancing supports FI by:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Keeping risk aligned with your timeline</li>
    <li>Reducing emotional decision-making</li>
    <li>Supporting long-term consistency</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It’s not about maximizing returns.
    It’s about staying invested through different seasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    Rebalancing doesn’t require spreadsheets, predictions, or constant monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pick a simple rule.
    Apply it consistently.
    Move on with your life.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Next step:</strong> Write down your target allocation and one clear rebalancing rule.
    That’s enough.
