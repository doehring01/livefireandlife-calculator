  <h1>Asset Allocation Through Different FI Stages</h1>
  <p class="lede">Your risk isn’t constant. The right allocation at 28 is not the right allocation at 58. Here’s a stage-based approach that accounts for real-world cashflows and emotions.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>Stage 1 — Accumulation (heavy growth)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical tilt:</strong> 80–95% stock index funds, 5–20% bonds/cash.</li>
    <li>Priority: <em>low costs, broad diversification, high savings rate</em>.</li>
    <li>Rebalance annually or on 5–10% bands; avoid performance chasing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stage 2 — Transition (CoastFI / pre-retire)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a <strong>cash buffer</strong> (6–24 months of expenses) as you near work optionality.</li>
    <li>Glide from 90/10 toward 70/30 or 60/40 depending on needs and income stability.</li>
    <li>Start <strong>bucket planning:</strong> Cash (1–2 yrs), Bonds (3–7 yrs), Stocks (7+ yrs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stage 3 — Early FI (sequence-risk defense)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bucket strategy in action:</strong> Spend from cash; refill annually from bonds; refill bonds from stocks after good years.</li>
    <li>Consider <strong>guardrail withdrawals</strong> (e.g., start at 4%, cut 10% after bad years; raise 10% after strong years).</li>
    <li>Own <strong>tax-efficient</strong> funds in taxable; hold bonds in tax-deferred when possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stage 4 — Late Retirement (longevity and inflation)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Protect against late-life inflation (TIPS ladder, real assets) and cognitive load (simplify holdings).</li>
    <li>Evaluate annuities <em>as insurance</em> on longevity risk, not as a market bet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical rebalancing rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Annual date + tolerance bands (5–10%).</li>
    <li>Use new contributions/withdrawals to nudge back to target before selling.</li>
    <li>Harvest losses in taxable when bands break during down years.</li>
  </ul>

    <strong>Remember:</strong> Allocation isn’t moral virtue. It’s a tool to align your money with your next 1–10 years of real spending.
