  <h1>How Taxes Can Make or Break Your FI Plan</h1>
  <p class="lede">Two investors can retire with the same nest egg and live very different lives after taxes. Here’s how to plan across accounts and decades.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>The Tax Triangle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tax-deferred:</strong> 401(k)/403(b)/Traditional IRA/TSP — pre-tax now, taxable later.</li>
    <li><strong>Roth:</strong> Roth IRA/401(k) — after-tax now, tax-free later.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxable/Brokerage:</strong> Flexible access; dividends/cap gains taxed as you go.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout" style="background:#fff7ed;border:1px solid #fed7aa;padding:1rem;border-radius:.5rem;">
    <strong>Goal:</strong> Diversify <em>by tax treatment</em>, not just by asset class. This gives you options to manage brackets in retirement.
  </div>

  <h2>Tax “Breakers” to avoid</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early withdrawal penalties</strong> for tapping tax-deferred accounts before 59½ without a plan.</li>
    <li><strong>RMD squeezes:</strong> Large pre-tax balances cause high Required Minimum Distributions later.</li>
    <li><strong>Stealth cliffs:</strong> ACA premium loss, child credits phaseouts, Social Security taxation, NIIT, Medicare IRMAA.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tax “Makers” to use</h2>
  <h3>Roth Conversion Ladder</h3>
  <p>Convert pieces of pre-tax money to Roth in low-income years <em>before</em> RMD age. After 5 years, converted amounts are accessible tax- and penalty-free.</p>

  <h3>0% Long-Term Capital Gains Harvesting</h3>
  <p>In low-income years, realize long-term gains up to the top of the 0% bracket, then immediately rebuy to step up basis—without changing your position.</p>

  <h3>Bracket Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“Fill” the 12% or 22% bracket strategically with conversions.</li>
    <li>Coordinate withdrawals across <em>all three</em> account types to keep MAGI in target ranges (e.g., to retain ACA subsidies).</li>
    <li>Use HSAs as a stealth Roth for qualified expenses (invest, reimburse later).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Case study: same nest egg, different net spend</h2>
  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> $1.2M total; Scenario A is 90% pre-tax, 10% taxable. Scenario B is balanced across the triangle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> High RMDs, limited flexibility; loses ACA subsidy pre-65; pays more tax over 20 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Uses taxable + conversions to manage brackets; preserves subsidies; lower lifetime tax.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Action steps (annual rhythm)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Project income for next year (salary, dividends, interest, realized gains).</li>
    <li>Choose a <strong>target bracket</strong> and plan conversions/withdrawals to “fill” it.</li>
    <li>Harvest losses when appropriate to offset gains and ordinary income.</li>
    <li>Re-check during open enrollment (ACA/Medicare) for subsidy/IRMAA thresholds.</li>
  </ol>
