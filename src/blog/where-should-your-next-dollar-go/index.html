  <h1>Where Should Your Next Dollar Go? A Life-Stage Guide for FI</h1>
<p class="callout">
  If you want a detailed breakdown of how retirement accounts and brokerage accounts work,
  read <a href="/blog/max-out-401k-or-brokerage/">Should You Max Out Your 401(k) or Invest in a Brokerage?</a>.
  This post focuses on how to decide where your <em>next</em> dollar goes based on your current life stage.
</p>

  <p class="lede">
    Most FI plans don’t fail because people don’t save.
    They struggle because savings decisions don’t evolve as life changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The “best” place for your next dollar isn’t universal.
    It depends on taxes, flexibility needs, and how close you are to FI.
  </p>

  <h2>The mistake: treating contribution decisions as permanent</h2>
  <p>
    Many people decide early on where to invest — and never revisit it.
  </p>

  <p>
    What made sense at 25 may be suboptimal at 35.
    What worked pre-kids may not work during peak family years.
  </p>

  <h2>Early career: capture free money and optionality</h2>
  <p>
    In early career, income is growing and timelines are long.
  </p>

  <p>
    Common priorities:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Employer match in a 401(k)</li>
    <li>Building emergency savings</li>
    <li>Establishing good investing habits</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal isn’t perfection — it’s momentum and flexibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Mid-career: balancing taxes and access</h2>
  <p>
    Mid-career often brings higher income and higher complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where many FI plans quietly break down.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How valuable is the current tax deduction?</li>
    <li>Will I need access before age 59½?</li>
    <li>Am I over-concentrated in one tax bucket?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For many people, a mix of tax-advantaged and taxable investing
    provides the best balance.
  </p>

  <h2>Approaching FI: flexibility starts to matter more</h2>
  <p>
    As FI approaches, access and tax control matter as much as growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over-funding tax-deferred accounts can limit early retirement options.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brokerage assets provide:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Spending flexibility</li>
    <li>Tax-planning opportunities</li>
    <li>Bridges to traditional retirement accounts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How taxes change the decision</h2>
  <p>
    Taxes don’t just affect how much you keep —
    they affect when you can use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A tax deduction today may cost flexibility tomorrow.
    Paying some taxes now can buy options later.
  </p>

  <h2>A simple framework for your next dollar</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Need liquidity soon?</strong> → Brokerage</li>
    <li><strong>In a high tax bracket?</strong> → Pre-tax retirement</li>
    <li><strong>Expect lower income later?</strong> → Tax diversification</li>
    <li><strong>Unsure?</strong> → Split contributions intentionally</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    The best FI plans don’t optimize one account forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    They revisit the question:
    “Where should my next dollar go?”
    as life evolves.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Next step:</strong> Look at where your last year of contributions went —
    and decide if that still matches your current priorities.
