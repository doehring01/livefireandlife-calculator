      <h1 style="margin-bottom:.75rem;">Why FI Is More Than the 4% Rule</h1>
      <p style="font-size:1.1rem;color:#555;">
        The 4% rule is a great <em>starting point</em>—but Financial Independence isn’t a single number or a single percentage. 
        Real life is messier: taxes, market swings, healthcare, childcare, aging parents, career pivots. 
        If your FI plan doesn’t adapt, your plan (or your happiness) pays the price. That’s why we use <a href="/flexfi/"><strong>FlexFI</strong></a>.

      <h2>What the 4% Rule Actually Says</h2>
      <p>
        The 4% guideline comes from historical backtests suggesting that withdrawing 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement 
        (and adjusting that dollar amount for inflation each year) succeeded most of the time over 30-year periods. It’s a shorthand, not a guarantee.

      <h2>What the 4% Rule Misses in Real Life</h2>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Taxes</h3>
          <p>Withdrawal taxes vary by account type (pre-tax, Roth, brokerage) and state. Your “4%” may not be spendable cash.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Sequence Risk</h3>
          <p>Early bad markets can hurt a lot more than average returns suggest. Flexibility beats rigid withdrawal rules.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Spending Changes</h3>
          <p>Kids, housing, travel, health—your spending will shift. Plans should handle up/down years without panic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Purpose & Joy</h3>
          <p>Optimizing every dollar can backfire if you cut the things that keep you motivated and connected.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">A Better Lens: FlexFI</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/flexfi/"><strong>FlexFI</strong></a> treats FI as a path with seasons—not a cliff you jump off at a magic number. 
        Contribute more in high-income years, throttle back for childcare or caregiving, and use part-time or project work to bridge early years. 
        You’re still racing the rat race—just with steering, brakes, and a map.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Start: Apply FlexFI to Your Numbers</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Verify your baseline.</strong> Track net worth and FI net worth. Try our <a href="/calculators/net-worth-tracker/">Net Worth Tracker</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Know your take-home.</strong> See how contributions/taxes affect cash flow with the <a href="/calculators/take-home-pay/">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress test.</strong> Model a lean year (extra childcare/health costs) and a strong year (bonus, promotions). Adjust savings—don’t quit the plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix accounts.</strong> Aim for tax diversification (pre-tax, Roth, brokerage) to control taxes later.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Rule of Thumb (Flexible, Not Fixed)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start from a conservative 3.5%–4.0% range.</li>
        <li>Withdraw less in down markets; raise a bit in strong markets.</li>
        <li>Use part-time income in early years to reduce portfolio stress.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="card" style="margin:1rem 0;">
        <h3>Try This in 10 Minutes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Run your current numbers in the <a href="/calculators/take-home-pay/">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a>.</li>
          <li>Save two scenarios: “Base year” and “Stretch year.”</li>
          <li>Pick one FlexFI adjustment this month (e.g., +1% to 401(k) or a targeted expense cut that doesn’t hurt joy).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        The 4% rule helps you start the conversation. <strong>FlexFI</strong> helps you live it. 
        If you can adapt contributions, spending, and work hours across life’s seasons, you’ll likely reach FI faster—and enjoy more of the journey.
