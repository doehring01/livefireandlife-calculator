  <h1>About FIREandLife</h1>
  <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> Bringing clarity to Financial Independence while balancing fulfillment with the time you're given.</p>

  <h2>Why Balance Matters</h2>
  <p>Pursuing Financial Independence (FI) gives you control over your time and choices. But the journey matters just as much as the destination. At FIREandLife, we believe that achieving FI should not mean sacrificing what makes life meaningful today.</p>

  <h3>Life Happens Along the Way</h3>
  <p>Unexpected events—health issues, family changes, economic shifts—are part of life. Your FI plan should support resilience and adaptability, not rigid perfection.</p>

  <h3>Joy Now Matters for Mental Health</h3>
  <p>Denying yourself joy for years in the name of saving can harm mental health and relationships. Life isn't just about numbers—it's about meaning and connection.</p>

  <h3>If You Can’t Enjoy Life Now, You Won’t Later</h3>
  <p>Many assume happiness will start “once I reach FI.” The truth? If you don’t know how to live well now—even on a budget—you’ll struggle later, too.</p>

  <h3>Finding Purpose Beyond Money</h3>
  <p>One of the most overlooked aspects of FI is purpose. Saving the most money isn’t the end goal. Living intentionally, aligning spending with values, and building a fulfilling life is what matters.</p>

  <p>FIREandLife exists to give you tools, clarity, and a community to thrive on your path to FI—without sacrificing what makes life meaningful today.</p>
