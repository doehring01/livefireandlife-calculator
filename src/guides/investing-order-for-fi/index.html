  <h2>The FI Investing Order of Operations</h2>

  <article class="card" id="step1">
    <h3>1) Emergency Savings: at least $1,000</h3>
    <p>Start with a small but fast buffer. One unexpected bill should not push you into credit card debt. Keep this in a high-yield savings account. Ease of access matters more than the perfect account.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="card" id="step2">
    <h3>2) Pay Off High-Interest Debt</h3>
    <p>
      The term “high-interest debt” can be a bit variable. Most people in the FI community consider it to be anything above what you can reasonably expect in long term returns from an S&amp;P 500 index fund.
      It is usually safe to say that any debt above about 7 to 8 percent can outrun market returns, so eliminate it early. Many people use one of two methods:
    </p>
    <div class="grid" style="margin-top:.75rem;">
      <article class="card">
        <h4>Debt Snowball</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay the smallest balance first while making minimums on the rest.</li>
          <li>Once that balance is gone, roll the freed-up payment into the next smallest debt.</li>
          <li>This method builds motivation quickly.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h4>Debt Avalanche</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay the debt with the highest interest rate first.</li>
          <li>Then roll payments down the line.</li>
          <li>This saves the most money in interest and often pays off debts faster overall.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:.5rem;">
      The important thing is to pick the method you will finish. If you need momentum, go with the snowball. If you want to minimize total cost, choose the avalanche.
    </p>

  <article class="card" id="step3">
    <h3>3) Get Your Full Employer Match</h3>
    <p>
      If your employer offers a match in a 401(k), 403(b), or TSP, contribute at least enough to capture the full match.
      Some call it free money. At minimum, it is part of your total compensation, and it is a guaranteed return with no market risk.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="card" id="step4">
    <h3>4) Save Six Months of Expenses</h3>
    <p>
      Once your high-interest debt is gone and your employer match is secured, expand your emergency fund to roughly six months of essential expenses.
      Six months is a good average. Depending on your situation, such as entrepreneurship or nearing retirement, you may want to save more.
      Keep this in a high-yield savings account or a short-term Treasury ladder. The goal is stability so you never have to sell investments at a bad time.
    </p>

  <article class="card" id="step5">
    <h3>5) Max Out an HSA if Available</h3>
    <p>Health Savings Accounts are one of the best tools for FI because they offer a triple tax advantage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributions are tax-deductible.</li>
      <li>Growth is tax-free.</li>
      <li>Qualified withdrawals for medical expenses are also tax-free.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If cash flow allows, pay current medical expenses out of pocket and let your HSA grow for future healthcare needs.
      In retirement, withdrawals for non-medical expenses are taxed like a traditional IRA, which means it can still serve as a long-term savings tool.
    </p>

  <article class="card" id="step6-7">
    <h3>6 or 7) Max a 401(k) or Max a Roth IRA</h3>
    <p>This is where your strategy gets personal. The right choice depends on your tax bracket today compared to what you expect in retirement.</p>

    <div class="grid" style="margin-top:.75rem;">
      <article class="card">
        <h4>Choose the 401(k) first if:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You are in a high current tax bracket and benefit more from the deduction now.</li>
          <li>Your employer plan is low cost and offers solid fund options.</li>
          <li>You plan to do Roth conversions later when your income is lower.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h4>Choose the Roth IRA first if:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You expect to be in a higher tax bracket later in life.</li>
          <li>You want flexible access to contributions if needed.</li>
          <li>You prefer more investment choices and direct control.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:.5rem;">Many people contribute to both as their income grows.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="card" id="step8">
    <h3>8) Invest Remaining Funds in a Taxable Brokerage</h3>
    <p>
      After you have filled the tax-advantaged buckets, direct extra savings into a taxable brokerage account.
      This gives you flexibility for early retirement, career breaks, or large purchases.
      Stick to broad, low cost, tax efficient index funds and be intentional with how you realize capital gains.

<!-- FlexFI note -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>FlexFI: Adjust by Season</h2>
  <p>
    Life is not static, and your investing order should not be either.
    During seasons like childcare, caregiving, or career transitions, you might pause contributions and focus on liquidity.
    In high earning years, you can push harder into tax advantaged accounts.
    The order is a guide, not a rulebook. You are allowed to flex.
