      <h1>5 Ways to Maximize Your Take-Home Pay</h1>
      <p>Your gross salary isn’t the same as what hits your bank account. If you want to keep more of what you earn, it’s all about smart planning. Here are five proven strategies to boost your take-home pay without asking for a raise.</p>

      <h2>1. Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts</h2>
      <p>Pre-tax contributions to accounts like 401(k)s, Traditional IRAs, and HSAs reduce your taxable income. This means you pay less in taxes now, and more of your money works for you long-term.</p>

      <h2>2. Maximize Your HSA</h2>
      <p>If you have a high-deductible health plan, an HSA is a triple-tax-advantaged account: contributions are tax-free, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free. Plus, it lowers your taxable income today.</p>

      <h2>3. Adjust Your Tax Withholding</h2>
      <p>If you consistently get large tax refunds, you’re essentially giving the IRS an interest-free loan. Adjust your W-4 so you have more money in your paycheck throughout the year.</p>

      <h2>4. Take Advantage of Employer Benefits</h2>
      <p>Some employers offer commuter benefits, flexible spending accounts (FSAs), or tuition assistance. These perks can reduce taxable income and save you real money.</p>

      <h2>5. Optimize Insurance Premiums</h2>
      <p>Compare rates and ensure you’re not overpaying for coverage. Bundling policies or increasing deductibles can lead to significant savings.</p>
