  <h1>5 Ways to Maximize Your Take-Home Pay</h1>
  <p>When you’re pursuing Financial Independence (FI), every dollar counts—not just what you earn, but what you keep. Maximizing your take-home pay can accelerate your FI timeline without requiring a raise. Let’s dive in.</p>

  <h2>1. Optimize Tax-Advantaged Contributions</h2>
  <p>Contribute to your <strong>401(k)</strong>, <strong>HSA</strong>, and <strong>IRA</strong> whenever possible. These reduce taxable income and grow tax-deferred. For example, if you make $80,000 and contribute $19,500 to your 401(k), your taxable income drops significantly—potentially lowering your federal tax bracket.</p>
  <p>Use our <a href="../calculators/take-home-pay.html">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a> to see the impact of pre-tax contributions.</p>

  <h2>2. Revisit Your Withholding</h2>
  <p>If you consistently get large tax refunds, you’re giving the government an interest-free loan. Adjust your W-4 for accurate withholding to keep more cash in each paycheck.</p>

  <h2>3. Leverage Pre-Tax Employer Benefits</h2>
  <p>Benefits like commuter programs, FSAs, and dependent care accounts let you pay for essentials with pre-tax dollars—boosting your take-home pay.</p>

  <h2>4. Evaluate Insurance Options</h2>
  <p>High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) paired with an HSA often cost less overall for healthy individuals. Compare your annual premiums and out-of-pocket risk before deciding.</p>

  <h2>5. Explore Side Income with Tax Planning</h2>
  <p>Side hustles can supercharge savings, but don’t forget tax strategy. Consider a SEP IRA or Solo 401(k) to shelter additional income.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
  <p>Small tweaks in pre-tax contributions and benefits can make a big difference on your FI path. Start by running your numbers in our <a href="../calculators/take-home-pay.html">Take-Home Pay Calculator</a>.</p>
